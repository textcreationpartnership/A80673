         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Of this, without turning over Chronicles, or ſearching the muſty Records of Antiquity, or (what is more poor) fobbing the Reader with an idle Romantick Story, where the Scene is laid in ſome remore and unknown Country, to make it eaſier to be believed than diſproved, our preſent Subject affords us at home an unhappy Inſtance.</p>
            <p>A jolly Gang of the Town, who lived like brids of prey, or people in that State of Nature, which ſome idle Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have of late recommended ſo far, as to juſtle out of credit the notions of good and evil, and thoſe pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique terms, <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum;</hi> having a fancy to drive their Trade in theſe dead times) to the beſt advantage, and make themſelves Maſters of what they could get, concluded there was no ſafer way to accompliſh their deſigns, than to Maſque themſelves in the mantle of Authority, hoping they might ſo unexpectedly commit the greateſt outrages with Indemnity, ſince it paſſed under the ſemblance of a warrantable and ſecuring Office.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:172006:3"/>
            <p>To this purpoſe they dreſs up a principal and well experienced member of their Fraternity, in his Gown, Cap, Staff, and all the formalities of a Conſtable, the reſt being put into a ſuitable Garb, and reverendly attending him as his Watchmen.</p>
            <p>In this poſture they ſet out about Ten or Eleven a Clock in the Night, and paſt in their rambling progreſs ſeveral Watches, giving and receiving the uſual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, <hi>Good Night Brother,</hi> to the Conſtables.</p>
            <p>This company knocking furiouſly, as with authority at a private houſe door, they commanded the people to riſe and open the Door, which being done, they pretend a Warrant which they had ready contrived with the Name of a Juſtice of Peace, and his Seal Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited to it; To Inquire and apprehend if they could, certain perſons therein named and mentioned, as Clipers of Money; Whereupon the People well knowing their Innocency from harbouring any people of that ſtamp, admited them very freely to ſearch; But they pretending though the perſons were not then preſent, they ought to make diligent ſcrutiny for braſs and Clipp'd Money, claimed a Priviledge of opening all Cloſets, Cheſts, Drawers, and Truncks: VVhere
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172006:4"/>at laſt happening to find fifty ſeven pound and odd Money, they picking out thereof three or four narrow Clipp'd Shillings, took the Confidence to acquaint the Folks that they muſt ſeize all the ſaid Money for the Kings uſe, till further Order; VVhereupon the ſame was depoſited in the pretended Conſtables hands, who pretendedly gave them a very fair account of his Name and dwelling, which they ſeeing him thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended never ſuſpected to be falſe.</p>
            <p>Having in their firſt enterprize of this nature ſped thus ſucceſsfully and diſpatch'd away ſome of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to Lodge the prize; they march on and give the alarm to an Ale-houſe, which ſoon ſurrendred and gave entrance at the ſight of the Staff and Halberts: Here they pretend to ſearch for ſtolen plate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that pretence carried away all the plate they could find in the houſe, leaving another name and dwelling for the owner to enquire at for it. This particular booty was worth above twenty pound.</p>
            <p>Now going farther, they ſteer their courſe to an Eminent Shop-keepers Houſe, make them riſe, and pretend they come to ſearch for <hi>French</hi> prohibited goods: under which notion they diſburden his Shop and Ware-houſe of above one hundred pounds worth of Commodities. But this Gentleman ſmoaking the cheat when they went forth, at firſt Doggs them, then gets afore them, and cauſes the Watch to ſtop them: In which Confuſion ſome made their eſcape; but the counterfeit Conſtable, and ſeveral of his pretended Watch were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:172006:4"/>and being carried before a Juſtice of Peace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Newgate;</hi> where having fenced with the Law for three or four Seſsions.
